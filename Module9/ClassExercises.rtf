\
4. There are 2^N-1 moves needed for a puzzle with N disks. This is an exponential algorithm. \
\
7. TowerOfHanoi is tail recursion.\
\
9. The program didn\'92t make a path of the desired length because the neighbors were all visited.\
\
10. MazeMaker2 does provide a complete path covering all cells. The execution time was very short.\
\
12. MazeMaker4 does not find a solution because there are no unvisited open neighbors. It chose the wrong path.\
\
13. MazeMaker5 does find a solution. No dead-ends were reach in trying to find this path. \
\
14. There is no solution for 3 queens on a 3x3 board. 3 queens can be placed on a 4x4 board. \
